Greenwald's book was published on May 13th.  Cryptome is <a target="_blank" href="http://cryptome.org/2014/05/npth.7z">distributing a copy</a> for free.  You can read why <a target="_blank" href="http://cryptome.org/2014/05/npth-freed.htm">here</a>.  

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/reviews/books/item/18351-book-review-no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald">Here's a book review</a>, or at least something dubbed a book review.

And <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/book-reviews/no-place-to-hide-monumentally-important-book-shines-a-spotlight-on-the-surveillance-state/article18628670/">here's another</a> non-review book review that has some good points, such as: 

<blockquote>Governments, and even the woollier notions of Power and Authority, count on apathy. Theyâ€™re emboldened by a slumped NSA contractor copy/pasting a Clipart leprechaun hat into a PowerPoint presentation, and by the shrugging citizenry bored with their own liberty. No Place to Hide is a persuasive, thrilling and necessary argument for shaking off this entitled boredom; for holding governments accountable, disentangling the knotty rat king of bureaucracy and pushing back against the rule by Nobody.</a>
