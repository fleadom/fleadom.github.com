The name "Flea" comes from the book "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Flea-Classic-Guerrilla-Warfare/dp/1574885553">War Of The Flea</a>"

To be clear, I'm not advocating violence, but the name "Flea" is certainly fitting with a lowly citizen intellectually confronting the Colossus of government.

This blog is semi-anonymous.  I've taken somewhat reasonable steps to disconnect this online identity with my real identity.  It's impossible to truly hide one's identity from a nation-state but I don't plan on provoking a nation-state to the point where it would be desireable to find me.  

Why hide?  While nothing I'm doing here is illegal, it's still plausible for a government or members of a government to harass me in various ways (think: IRS).

Surveillance techniques that prevent individuals remaining anonymous when producing or accessing information both infringe privacy and have a chilling effect on free expression.</blockquote>

This blog is a place for me to share information and articulate opinions and in doing so, hopefully find like-minded individuals.
